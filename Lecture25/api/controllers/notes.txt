step-1 Find the specific document to update.(by using Module.exports.updateOne)
step-2 update the model instance
step-3 save the model instance and this will actually save it back to the mongoDb.
This save method applies directly to the model instance and returns a callback which accepts two parameters, err and the second parameter is the updated document returned from the database.
We do this by using doc.save() method where document is the model instance 
step-4 finally send the response to the requester.
