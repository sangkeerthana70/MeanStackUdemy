The index.html is served even it the index.html is omitted in the url path because
of the static set up pointing to the public folder in the middleware app.use.

Instead of serving the index.html from the static folder from the app.use 
middleware we are going to give a subset of routes as url in the '/public' routes.
like localhost:8080/public/index.html.
